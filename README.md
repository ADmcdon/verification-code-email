Member Verification Email README

Welcome to the Member Verification Email README! 

The member verification email is a tool to verify that the person who signed up for your brand's membership is indeed the person who owns the email address provided during the registration process. This email will help you keep your customer information up to date and secure.

I still need to add a feature to add random generated numbers and a way to insert customer name into the email.

this exercise was for recreating a design

I used internal styling and tables to recreate the layout of a recent email I recieved from Nike
